This project aims to develop an  software application that leverages speech-to-text technology to translate spoken language into sign language(ASL)

In this project we're going to test a specific greeting sentence 👇🏿
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"Hello guys ! my name is (your name)"

"i am from (your country), actually i am a student"

"Welcome to CS50"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

STEPS:

Step 1: Pronounce the greeting phrase using speech recognition.

Step 2: The text appears on the screen.

Step 3: The text is directly translated into ASL (American Sign Language).

French Step: Conduct the test a french student; the greeting phrase will be translated into French Sign Language (LSF), and a video related to French culture and people is launched.
