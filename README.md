This project aims to develop an  software application that leverages speech-to-text technology to translate spoken language into sign language(ASL)

PROJECT STRUCTURE :
-------------------

project.py

test_project.py

requirements.txt

README.md


IN THIS PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO TEST A SPECIFIC GREETING SENTENCE BELOW 👇🏿
-------------------------------------------------------------------
                      "Hello guys ! my name is (your name)"

                "i am from (your country), actually i am a student"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

STEPS
------

Step 1: Pronounce the greeting phrase using speech recognition.

Step 2: The text appears on the terminal.

Step 3: The text is directly translated into ASL (American Sign Language).

French Step: Conduct the test like a french student 🇫🇷; the greeting phrase will be translated into French Sign Language (LSF), and a video related to French culture and people is launched.

Cameroon Step: Conduct the test like a Cameroon student 🇨🇲; the greeting phrase will be translated into French Sign Language (LSF), and a cameroon scene from  LA CASA DE PAPEL is launched.

American Step: Conduct the test like a American student 🇺🇸; the greeting phrase will be translated in ASL , and a scene Wednesday is launched.
