------------------------------------------------

This project aims to develop an software application that leverages speech-to-text technology to translate spoken language into sign language(ASL)

### Text Template Loading: 
The program reads a text template from the greetingTemplate.txt file, which serves as a reference sentence.

### Speech Capture: 
Using a microphone, the program listens to the user’s spoken input and adjusts for background noise to improve recognition accuracy.
### Audio Processing: 
The captured audio is saved as a .wav file, and speech recognition converts it into text, saving the output to book.txt.
### Text Comparison: 
The spoken text is compared to the text template. If the words match perfectly, the program proceeds.
### Video Playback: 
Upon a successful match, a video file specified by the video_path variable is played using OpenCV.
### Error Handling: 
The program accounts for various errors, such as missing files, speech recognition failures, or issues with video playback.
### Feedback: 
Clear messages guide the user throughout the process, from speaking to watching the video.
### Exit Option: 
The video playback can be stopped anytime by pressing the 'Q' key.
This project is an excellent demonstration of combining real-time speech recognition with multimedia interaction.

IN THIS PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO TEST A SPECIFIC GREETING SENTENCE BELOW 👇🏿
-------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     "Hello world"

                                  "i am from america,"

STEPS
------

### Step 1: launch the program : python3 project.py

### Step 2: follow the instruction, said the greeting template sentence

### step3 3: Enjoy the asl video if your words == greeting template.
